TODO list: 
Item panel           (Hero, item, cooldown)
Ability panel        (Hero, ability, cooldown, level(?), manacost(?))
Enemy No Buttons     (Check, if hero cant cast anything dangerous(?) because of cooldowns or no mana)
Enemy Ward Wasted    (Remember vec3 position when enemy wasted his wards, if enemy in your team sight. Put timer at this position)  
Enemy Vision Radius  (Set particle circle at hero to see, how far he can see. Personal for every hero, no constant ranges)
Afk detector         (Will show, how long teammate dont move. Internal timer, which get zero value, if you ordered hero to move, and increases, while no orders)
Minimap draw         (just like vec3 draw, but also on minimap)
